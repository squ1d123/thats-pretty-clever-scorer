# Maintainer Notes
MaintainerNotes: |
  This app is built using Go with the Fyne UI framework for cross-platform compatibility.
  The build process uses the Fyne CLI to package the application for Android.
  
  Key requirements for successful builds:
  - Go 1.24+ should be available in the build environment
  - Fyne CLI is installed during prebuild phase
  - App icon should be present as Icon.png in repo root
  - Build produces standard Android APK with proper package name
  
  The app is completely offline and does not require any special permissions,
  making it ideal for privacy-conscious users. All game data is stored locally
  using SQLite database embedded in the application.
